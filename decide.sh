# it classified on the EXIT CODE alone, and a CLI that crashes (an old version without
# --base, a bad flag, a runtime error) also exits 1 with no JSON on stdout. That was
# reported to the user as "found a conflict with a recorded decision" - "could not run"
# presented as "found something", the precise confusion the `unknown` status exists to stop.

# Usage: decide.sh <exit-code> <status> <fail-on>
#   status is parsed from the CLI's JSON; "error" when there was none to parse.
# Prints a one-line outcome. Exits 0 if the job should pass, 1 if it should fail.

# codes are live depending on the pin. The STATUS is what separates it either way, which
# is why this classifies on status and the truth table still covers the exit-0 row.

# This deliberately does NOT test `!= aligned`. That spelling classified `no-context` as
# incomplete, so under fail-on=conflict-or-unknown a required check blocked every PR whose
# diff the graph had no decisions about (align-stack#1482). It also inverted the point of
# the `unknown` status (align-cli#76): "we found nothing" and "we could not look" were
# folded back together, which is the distinction that status exists to draw.
