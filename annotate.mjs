 * exercise it is to push to a real repository, which is how a stray `esac` once shipped.
 *
 * The anchor comes from `conflicts[].matched_files`, which the gateway populates with the
 * files whose segment retrieved the conflicting decision (align-stack#1652). Before that the
 * only available output was a bare conflict title in the job log, with nothing tying it to a
 * line a reviewer could open.
 *
 * This NEVER decides the gate. decide.sh owns pass/fail; everything here is presentation, and
 * a failure to render must not turn a real verdict into a broken build.
